## Personal Expense Tracker
This dataset records my personal expenses over one week (from 30th September 2025 to 7th October 2025). It captures every financial transaction made during that period, allowing me to monitor and analyze my spending behavior. Each record includes:

* **Date:** The day of the transaction
* **Category:** The type of expense (e.g., Food, Transport, Shopping)
* **Amount (GHS):** How much was spent in Ghanaian Cedis
* **Payment Method:** How the payment was made (Cash, MoMo, or Card)
* **Description:** A short note describing the transaction

### Why It Qualifies as Structured Data
The dataset is structured in a tabular form, where each column represents a specific attribute and every row represents a single observation. Each field contains consistent data types, numerical values for amounts, text for categories, and dates for transaction days, making it easily interpretable by data analysis tools like Excel, Power BI, or Pythonâ€™s pandas library.

### Insights
1. **Top Spending Category:** Food = accounting for a significant portion of total expenses across all days.
2. **Most Used Payment Method:** Mobile Money (MoMo) = preferred for convenience, especially for digital purchases.
3. **Peak Spending Day:** October 2nd = due to clothing purchases and food orders.

This dataset can be used to visualize weekly spending trends, identify budget leaks, and plan more efficient personal finances.
